          <h1>What is Climate Change</h1>
        </div>
          <p>Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. <br> 
          Climate change is a shift in those average conditions. <br>
          The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport. <br>
          When these fossil fuels burn, they releases greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise. <br>          
          The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.

          <p>
          Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods. <br>
         With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. <br>  
          In other regions, the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. <br>
          People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. <br> 
         Many farms in developing countries already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.

         <h1><b>How pandas are effecting by Climate Change?</b></h1>
        </div>
          <p>
          Though they are one of the most beloved animal species on Earth, pandas aren't safe from the devastating effects of climate change. <br>
          According to a new study, projected temperature increases in China over the next century will likely seriously hinder bamboo, almost the sole source of food for endangered pandas. <br>
          Only if bamboo can move to new habitats at higher elevations will pandas stand a chance, the researchers said. <br>
          However, if conservation programs wait too long, human inhabitants and activities could claim all of the new habitats capable of supporting bamboo in a warming world.
